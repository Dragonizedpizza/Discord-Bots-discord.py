# Discord Bots with Discord.py
In todays world discord.gg and discord.com is one of the biggest online chatting platforms
Whether your in school, work, or college almost everyone uses it.

But why is discord better than whatsapp or teams, they are huge tech empires and have plenty of money to spend. 

The real answer is that discord has bots! You can create your own bot today in discord, and you don't even need to pay money.

With 100 lines of simple JavaScript and JSON you can setup your bot!!!
Sounds amazing right! Discord has many libraries and methods to actually make your own bot! Which is good isn't it!

These are some of them:
* discordcr [Link](https://github.com/discordcr/discordcr) - In Crystal
* DiscordGo
* Discordrb
* discord.js
* discord.py
* JDA

And many many more! But on this we are using **discord.py**!
So now I have put an awesome economy bot like Dank Memer and EPIC RPG!
We use JSON as a database. If you didn't know you can use json in python:
```py
import json

with open("mainbank.json", "r") as f:
    users = json.load(f)

```

## Taking and using the code
To use this code make sure you have the comments set up, but DO NOT plagiarise and give credits.

Do NOT take ownership of writing the code! If you follow this stuff be sure to do this

My bot's token is not revealed, make a new bot. If you don't like coding it and stuff. Just invite my bot [here](https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?&client_id=768695035092271124&scope=bot&permissions=2147483383)

That's for the economy. If you want a fully functional moderation bot then search up a bot called Dragon God. Super good for mod and automod!

I do have a moderation bot, but its only 200 lines of code. And thus not up to the mark.
